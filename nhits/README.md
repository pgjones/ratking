# NHits
The code in this folder demonstrates running rat and then plotting the various nhit numbers. 
Note the detector efficiency when comparing the numbers.

 - Num PE : The number of photoelectrons acquired by the DAQ.
 - MC Hits : The number of PMTs to have a least 1 photo-electron
 - EV hits : The number of PMT hits that pass discriminator and are recorded in the event - after the daq.
